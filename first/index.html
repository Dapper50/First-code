      <p>
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that styles web content. For example it can be used to make a text red, to make content display at a certain location in the (webpage) layout and to decorate a webpage with background images and colours.

      <h2 class="under">What is CSS?</h2>
      <p>
        Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. <strong>CSS is a style sheet language.</strong> CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements. For example, By using a text editor and saving the file as style.css in a directory named styles you can style and colour on an HTMl document, we would specify that it is  a paragraph with the paragraph tag and include the word colour in a text. then apply the code in your HTML document to effect changes. Afterwards open the HTML file to link style sheet.

      <p>The whole structure is called a ruleset. (The term ruleset is often referred to as just rule.) Note the names of the individual parts:
          <br>
          <ol>
              <li>
             <strong>Selector:</strong> This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example, elements). To style a different element, change the selector.</li>
              <li>
              <strong>Declaration:</strong> These are ways in which you can style an HTML element. (In this example, color is a property of the elements.) In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule.</li>
              <li>
               <strong>Property value:</strong> To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property value. This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property. (For example, there are many color values in addition to red.)</li>
          </ol>
          
        </p>
        
        <h2>CSS: all about boxes</h2>
            Something you'll notice about writing CSS: a lot of it is about boxes. This includes setting size, color, and position.

            <br>
            <br>
            CSS layout is mostly based on the box model. Each box taking up space on your page has properties like:
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>padding, the space around the content. In the example below, it is the space around the paragraph text.</li>
                <li>border, the solid line that is just outside the padding.</li>
                <li>margin, the space around the outside of the border.</li>
            </ul>
